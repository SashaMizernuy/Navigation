# Navigation
A project using a MapBox api. The user may place several markers on the map,
and then clicking on the button "Bouild Road" will draw a line along the stamped markers.
At the second stage, the user can click on the "Start navigation" button and navigate to the specified route. 
Thank you for viewing.
